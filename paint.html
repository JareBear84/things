    <P>The most amazing thing about art, whether it is written, performance, or visual, is the joy that comes from creating something out of a blank page, stage or canvas.</P>

     <P>Being a husky guy, I've been compared to a bear my whole life. Even to the point I was nicknamed "Jarebear" during my undergrad yearsI use a common technique called <EM>wet-on-wet</EM>. It's where the canvas is pre-painted with a base coat of paint thet helps the paint blend and push easier. Bob Ross, the famous painter of the 80s and 90s used the same style.</P>
